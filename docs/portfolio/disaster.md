### Emergency Mapping
<p><img src="/gifs/vaps.gif" width="450" height="380">
As the primary data analysis node (P-DAN) of Sentinel Asia, the Geoinformatics center of AIT has been effectively engaged in disaster response using Remote Sensing and web-GIS technology.
In this project, I was mainly involved in satellite data processing and Value-added products generation for a range of disaster types(Eg. Flood, Earthquake, GLOF, Forest fire, Oil spill, etc.. ). SAR and Optical data analysis, Interferometric analysis, change detection, and offset tracking are some of the methods used in the products generation process.

### Project Manangement for International Disaster Charter (IDC)
<p><img src="/images/idc_web.PNG" width="500" height="440">
When a major disaster occurs, the Asian Disaster Reduction Center (ADRC) can escalate a Sentinel Asia emergency observation request to the International Disaster Charter (IDC). A project manager (PM), such as the GIC/AIT, will be nominated by relevant national agencies or international organizations. The PM's role is to ensure effective communication between the data providers or partner agencies (PA), value-added companies/resellers, and authorized users (AU). The PM will coordinate the activation while ensuring the products generation are according to the user's needs and expectations. 
During my work at AIT, I was nominated for two PM roles for four major natural disasters, and I have successfully managed the work and the communication between the Value adders, Space agencies, and End-members.

### Web-GIS for Disaster Response
<p>
<img src="/gifs/disaster_portal.gif" width="300" height="140"> 
I have developed a web-gis platform to integrate disaster-related satellite-derived results for activations activated through Sentinel Asia.
This platform gives the user effective visualization of the disaster extent with free open access to data products, and it helps better Emergency management activities.
ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS Enterprise Sites, and ArcGIS API for Python were used in this process to create Web-maps, Web-Apps, and sites.
