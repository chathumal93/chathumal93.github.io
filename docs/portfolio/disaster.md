### Emergency Mapping
<p><img src="/gifs/vaps.gif" width="450" height="380">
The Geoinformatics Center of the Asian Institute of Technology has been actively involved in disaster response efforts utilizing remote sensing and web-GIS technology as the primary data analysis node (P-DAN) for Sentinel Asia. In my capacity as a research associate in this initiative, I played a significant role in processing satellite data and creating value-added products that could be utilized in a variety of disaster scenarios, such as floods, earthquakes, GLOFs, forest fires, and oil spills. The methods employed in the product generation process included SAR and optical data analysis, interferometric analysis, change detection, and offset tracking.

### Project Manangement for International Disaster Charter (IDC)
<p><img src="/images/idc_web.PNG" width="500" height="440">
In the event of a significant disaster, the Asian Disaster Reduction Center (ADRC) may escalate an emergency observation request through Sentinel Asia to the International Disaster Charter (IDC). Relevant national agencies or international organizations will nominate a project manager (PM), such as the GIC/AIT, to oversee the process. The PM's primary responsibility is to ensure clear and efficient communication between data providers or partner agencies (PA), value-added companies/resellers, and authorized users (AU). Additionally, the PM will coordinate the activation process, guaranteeing the generated products meet the user's requirements and expectations.
During my tenure at AIT, I was nominated for seven PM roles related to seven significant natural disasters. I successfully managed the communication channels between the value adders, space agencies, and end-members.

### Web-GIS for Disaster Response
<p>
<img src="/gifs/disaster_portal.gif" width="300" height="140"> 
I have created a cutting-edge web-based geographic information system (GIS) platform designed to incorporate satellite-derived disaster-related information for activations initiated via Sentinel Asia. The platform provides users with powerful visualizations of the scope of the disaster, and offers free, open access to data products, thus facilitating improved emergency management activities. This was achieved through the utilization of sophisticated tools such as ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS Enterprise Sites, and ArcGIS API for Python, which enabled the creation of web-maps, web-applications, and sites.
