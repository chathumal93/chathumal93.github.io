### IWG-SEM
<p>I'm a member of the International Working Group on Satellite-based Emergency Mapping (IWG-SEM), a voluntary group of organizations involved in satellite-based emergency mapping. This group improves the cooperation, communication, and professional standards among the global network of satellite-based emergency mapping providers.
This membership was helpful for me to share the best practices and guidelines of disaster mapping activities, especially in the Sentinel Asia community.

### UR Field Lab
<p><img src="/images/floodlab.jpg" width="300" height="240">
I have volunteered in Chiang Mai Flood Lab 2019, organized by CO-RISK Lab and the World Bank as a resource person to introduce the effective use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in disaster times. Disaster vulnerability mapping and supporting relief efforts in post-disaster activities using the latest technology were the focus of this task.

### Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team

The purpose of the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap is to divide the mapping project into smaller tasks that can be completed rapidly and collaboratively, with many people contributing to a collective project goal, especially in disaster times. 
I'm an Intermediate mapper of the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team, which focuses on disaster and humanitarian relief and it was an excellent opportunity for me to contribute and aid disasters outside south-east Asia.
