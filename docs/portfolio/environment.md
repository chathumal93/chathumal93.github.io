### Ground Stability Monitoring
<p><img src="/gifs/adbg.gif" width="400" height="340">
I'm currently engaged in a project, which aims to monitor ground stability and reconstruction process in the Palu region, Indonesia, where there was a massive earthquake in 2018 September.  In this case, the ground motion information comes from the Persistence Scatter(PS)-InSAR products based on Sentinel-1 data processed from Geohazard Exploitation Platform (GEP). Using this ground motion data, I estimated the stability of infrastructures such as roads, buildings, and canals for monitoring purposes in the region.

### Forest Biomass Estimation
<p><img src="/images/biomass.PNG" width="400" height="340">
During my work at AIT, I researched estimating forest biomass in the Western Tiger Landscape of Nepal using a Satellite Remote Sensing approach based on Synthetic Aperture Radar and Optical data fusion. (ALOS PALSAR /Landsat)
Radar backscatter, texture parameters, vegetation indexes, and topographic features are used in a random forest algorithm based model to predict the final biomass estimation results.

### PM 2.5 Analysis over Bangkok

GCOM-C satellite conducts long-term and continuous global observation and data collection to contribute to surface and atmospheric measurements. Aerosol optical thickness is one of its products to identify the atmospheric changes in terms of aerosols. I have carried out a pilot study to find the suitability of GCOM-C aerosol optical thickness (AOT) products in air pollution identification. In this task, I converted raw data into AOT products, Identified PM 2.5 level variation in Bangkok from 2018 to 2020, and found spatial relationships between the burning of open land around Bangkok for aerosol thickness in the same region.

### Crop Health Monitoring

Geoinformatics Center with Ayutthaya Rice Research Center-Thailand initiated a study to investigate the relationship between plant nitrogen content with vegetation indexes integrating low-cost drones. This work also helps identify nitrogen deficiency, which causes low yield production in rice plants. During my internship, I collaborated with the GIC group to approximate nitrogen levels of rice by analyzing multispectral images obtained from drones(Parrot Sequoia multispectral sensor +DJI Phantom 3) and find the applicability of low-cost drones as a scouting tool for paddy fields.
