### Geodetic Triangulation
<p><img src="/images/geotri.jpg" width="250" height="150">
In my undergraduate program, I contributed to establish a high-accurate control network using the First Order Control Point Network of Sri Lanka. For a comparative study, new controls were observed using both triangulation and the GPS method.
In this case, we took angle observations from precise theodolites and used them in calculations with the mid-latitude formulae.
Finally, the network was adjusted using the method of variation of parameters. This task was a practical example for comparing traditional surveying methods with state-of-the-art surveying methods.

### Drone Mappping + GNSS Surveying
<p><img src="/images/road01.PNG" width="300" height="240">
During my work at GIC, I was involved in many drone survey activities for different purposes, including high-resolution ortho-map generation, crop health monitoring, object detection, and construction monitoring.
Accurate drone map products require additional highly accurate positioning methods such as Realt Time Kinematic, Network RTK, and Precise Point Positioning integrated into the image acquisition process.
In this case, I have experience in acquiring the RGB/Multispectral sensor data and combine them high accurate positional information.

<p>Road Construction Monitoring</p>
<img src="/images/road02.PNG" width="300" height="240">
Department of Highways (DOH), Thailand, the dedicated government agency for highway networks in Thailand, initiated a road expansion project in Rama  Rama 2 Highway in Samut Sakhon province. In this project, the Geoinformatics Centre of the Asian Institute of Technology (AIT) collaborated with DOH to provide up-to-date maps of the construction status of the target road. For this task, I engaged with our GIC team to perform real-time kinematic (RTK) surveys to obtain ground control points and integrate them with Drone data to produce highly accurate and high-resolution ortho map products.

### 3D Modelling
<p><img src="/gifs/ait3dmod.gif" width="400" height="340">
During my internship at the Asian Institute of Technology, I contributed to a group project for efficient planning and campus management by producing a campus 3D model.
In this task, I was involved in Drone data acquisition, processing, and visualization. Data was acquired using a DJI Phantom 3 Drone, and Bentley context capture software was used for the data processing.
