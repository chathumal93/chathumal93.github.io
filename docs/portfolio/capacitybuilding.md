<p><img src="/images/adb-training.png" width="350" height="250">
This training program was Jointly organized by ESA (European Space Agency), Asian Development Bank (ADB), BRIN (National Research and Innovation Agency - Indonesia), and LAPAN (National Institute of Aeronautics and Space-Indonesia) to share the knowledge on Earth observation science for water and food security in Indonesia. I delivered a knowledge-sharing session on infrastructure stability mapping over Central Sulawesi based on InSAR mapping technology in this training program.

<p><img src="/images/jptm.jpg" width="350" height="250">
I contributed as a resource person in a workshop organized in the 7th Joint Project Team Meeting for Sentinel Asia STEP-3 (JPTM2019), Bangkok.
The main focus of this task was to give young data analyzing nodes an overview of utilizing SAR data to identify the disaster-affected region ( Specially Flood) and produce value-added products.
