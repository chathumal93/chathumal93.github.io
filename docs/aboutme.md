I am presently working as a **Research Associate** at Geoinformatics Center, **Asian Institute of Technology(AIT)**, Thailand. My current work in AIT includes utilizing geospatial technologies to address real-world issues caused by natural disasters and environmental changes.
Furthermore, I perform Remote Sensing and GIS analysis for land cover mapping, forestry applications, air quality monitoring, and drone-based mapping and data processing for real-world applications.
