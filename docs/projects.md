# Pojects Involved

### Support for Emergency Assistance on Rehabilitation and Reconstruction in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia
> This project enhances the capacity of The Ministry of Public Works and Housing (MPWH) and the provincial and local government in monitoring reconstruction in Central Sulawesi Province, Indonesia, which was hit by a massive natural disaster resulting from the earthquake and tsunami on 28 September 2018. The module will complement the MPWH information system in providing information on critical infrastructure reconstruction, building and ground movements, and other information needed to support reconstruction monitoring.[Client: Asian Development Bank (ADB)].

### Strengthening Agro-climatic Monitoring and Information Systems (SAMIS) - Lao PDR
> The project “Strengthening Agro-climatic Monitoring and Information Systems (SAMIS) to improve adaptation to climate change and food security in LAO PDR” is increasing decision-making and planning capacity for the agricultural sector at national and decentralized levels in Lao PDR. Geoinformatics Center (GIC) of Asian Institute of Technology (AIT), Thailand collaborate with FAO to implement several training programs related to GIS and Satellite Image Analysis (Remote Sensing) and their application for the national, provincial, and local staff of Department of Meteorology and Hydrology (DMH) within the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE), and Department of Agricultural Land Management (DALaM) within the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF).[Client: Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)]

>**Activities Performed**

>- Forest biomass estimation using SAR and LiDAR data to materialize for capacity building programs

>- Conducted training on "Forest mapping and biomass estimation" using satellite remote sensing data

### Drone based Highway Construction Monitoring and Mapping
> Department of Highways (DOH), Thailand is the dedicated government agency for highway network in Thailand. DOH has initiated a project in Rama 2 road expanding from 9th Km to 21st km of the road and DOH considers providing up to date maps of the construction which will be helpful for the general public and also planning prospective. Geoinformatics Centre of Asian Institute of Technology (AIT) collaborate with DOH in this regard.[Client: Department of Highways (DOH)]
