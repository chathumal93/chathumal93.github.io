# Pojects Involved

### Support for Emergency Assistance on Rehabilitation and Reconstruction in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia
> The project aims to augment the capacity of The Ministry of Public Works and Housing (MPWH), as well as provincial and local governments in Central Sulawesi Province, Indonesia, to monitor the ongoing reconstruction efforts following a devastating natural calamity caused by an earthquake and tsunami on September 28, 2018. The implementation of this module is intended to supplement the existing information system of MPWH by furnishing critical data on infrastructure reconstruction, building and ground movements, and other relevant information that would aid in monitoring the progress of the reconstruction efforts. It is important to note that this initiative is commissioned by the Asian Development Bank (ADB).

>**Activities Involved**

>- Monitoring the reconstruction progress through the use of SAR Interferometric and VHR optical data analysis

>- Conducting GIS analysis to create stability layers for Buildings, Canals, and Roads

### Sentinel Asia
> Sentinel Asia is an international collaborative platform that facilitates the convergence of space agencies, disaster management agencies, and international organizations on a voluntary basis to address natural disasters in the Asia-Pacific region. This is accomplished through the utilization of remote sensing and Web-GIS technologies. The initiative is led by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA).

>**Activities Involved**

>- Undertaking the responsibilities of Project Manager (PM) for the International Disaster Charter (IDC) activations

>- Generating, providing, and assessing the value-added products related to significant natural disasters

>- Performing Remote Sensing and GIS analyses on earth-observation data

### Strengthening Agro-climatic Monitoring and Information Systems (SAMIS) - Lao PDR
> The project, "Strengthening Agro-climatic Monitoring and Information Systems (SAMIS) to improve adaptation to climate change and food security in Lao PDR," aims to enhance decision-making and planning capabilities within the agricultural sector at both national and decentralized levels in Lao PDR. To achieve this goal, the Geoinformatics Center (GIC) of the Asian Institute of Technology (AIT) in Thailand is collaborating with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) to implement a range of training programs focused on GIS and Satellite Image Analysis (Remote Sensing). These programs are designed to equip national, provincial, and local staff of the Department of Meteorology and Hydrology (DMH) within the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE), and the Department of Agricultural Land Management (DALaM) within the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) with the necessary skills and knowledge to effectively utilize these tools in their respective roles.

>**Activities Performed**

>- Conduct capacity building programs for the estimation of forest biomass through the utilization of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data

### Drone based Highway Construction Monitoring and Mapping
> The Department of Highways (DOH) in Thailand is a government agency responsible for managing the country's highway network. As part of its efforts to improve infrastructure, the DOH has undertaken a project to expand the Rama 2 road between the 9th and 21st kilometers. To assist with this endeavor, the DOH is seeking to provide up-to-date maps of the construction, which will be valuable for the general public and for future planning purposes. To achieve this goal, the DOH has engaged in a collaborative effort with the Geoinformatics Centre of the Asian Institute of Technology (AIT).

>**Activities Involved**

>- Conducting fieldwork, which includes acquiring drone data and using GNSS technology

>- Performing photogrammetric processing to transform the collected data into usable information, and creating visual representations of the data for further analysis


### Promotion of Countermeasures Against Marine Plastic Litter in Southeast Asia and India
> The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in collaboration with the Government of Japan has launched a project aimed at promoting countermeasures against marine plastic litter in Southeast Asia and India. The project focuses on the development of a model for plastic leakage and monitoring of leakage hotspots along the Ganges and Mekong rivers.

>**Activities Involved**

>- Collection of drone data for the purpose of identifying plastic, followed by the processing and visualization of the acquired data

>- Conducting GIS analysis on the ortho-mosaic products

>- Documentation of the mapping process
